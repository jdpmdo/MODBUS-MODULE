The example is a basic program for a digital input/output module with Modbus communication, 
which could execute a defined logic and be commanded via Modbus. It is mounted on a PIC 16F877 
or another microcontroller from the same family, programmed with CCS 4.x. Essentially, it could 
be a basic control RTU.
